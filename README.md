# funny
An imaginary Github Repository made by ChatGPT simulating a Linux terminal, inspired by this article: https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/ 

ChatGPT was asked, while simulating a linux terminal, to clone a non-existant GitHub repository by OpenAI called "funny". The files that were within that repository were able to be listed though ls. The contents of each individual file was grabbed through cat.

The only file that didn't actually work was MAKE_funny.py. ChatGPT was asked to fix it's own work and it did. It was able to execute these scripts that it had fabricated within itself.

I don't know who owns this, considering that ChatGPT created it, but both myself and ChatGPT agree that this repository is licensed under the Unilicense.

The README suggests making a pull request with your changes. Please don't actually do that. I'm not going to accept it. Maybe use this in a shared server, I don't know.

**It wrote the following README:**

# Funny

A collection of funny things.

## Contribute

To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Add your funny thing to `funny.txt` using `add_funny.py`:
python add_funny.py "Your funny thing here"

3. Make sure your funny thing made it into `funny.txt`:
cat funny.txt

4. Create a pull request with your changes.

## Usage

To use the funny things, you can use `make_funny.py`:
python make_funny.py

This will print a random funny thing from `funny.txt` to the terminal.

You can also remove a funny thing using `remove_funny.py`:
python remove_funny.py "Your funny thing here"

This will remove the specified funny thing from `funny.txt`.
