# funny
An imaginary Github Repository made by ChatGPT simulating a Linux terminal. This bot even wrote it's own README.

I don't know who should be considered responsible, but it's public domain.

The README suggests making a pull request with your changes. Please don't actually do that.

**It wrote the following README:**

# Funny
